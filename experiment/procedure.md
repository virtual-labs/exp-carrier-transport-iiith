### Procedure
#### Task-1
In the first task, the user is given two plots of drift current and two plots of diffusion current with different mobility.<br> 
The higher mobility is denoted by "a" and the lower mobility is denoted by "b". <br>
The user has to label each of the plots with their respective mobilty.<br>
#### Task-2
In the second task, there are interactive plots of drift and diffusion and the user can see how different parameters effect drift and diffrusion plots.
