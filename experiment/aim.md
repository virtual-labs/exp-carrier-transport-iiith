 Carrier motion under non-equilibrium conditions in the semiconductor is determined by carrier concentration gradient as well as applied electric field. Current flow in semiconductor is a function of material property (carrier concentration, mobility, diffusivity) as well as externally applied voltage/electric field and carrier concentration gradient. This set of virtual labs will help the student learn- how current is affected if any of the
 input or external parameters is changed. Students will learn about the carrier drift and diffusion current in semiconductor including small minority carrier injection.
